### A cross-browser extension for Twitter to bring [@WhatIsAWomanBot](https://twitter.com/WhatIsAWomanBot) features into your browser. Authored by [@bethylamine](https://twitter.com/bethylamine), with help from [@VehpuS](https://twitter.com/VehpuS).

## Features

* Highlight users on WhatIsAWomanBot's transphobe database

## Future Features

* Be able to highlight hashtags / report transphobic hashtags
* Hide media/tweets from transphobes behind interstitials (prevent shock posting)
* Add trans-supportive library tool to provide you with relevant trans-supportive information you can reply with quickly
* Auto-suggest debunking sources

If you have any cool ideas, please pop a message into the **Issues** tab, or message me, [@bethylamine](https://twitter.com/bethylamine), on Twitter.

## How to install

1. Download the repository (either by zip or with git, if you're comfortable) and save it somewhere.
2. Search for how to load an unpacked extension in your browser of choice, then select the `manifest-v3` directory as the extension.
3. For firefox, delete `manifest.json` and rename `manifest-firefox.json` to `manifest.json`, and load that.

## How to update
